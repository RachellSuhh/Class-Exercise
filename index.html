                <img src="img/Baies.jpeg">
                <p> The Baies (Berries) scented candle speaks of harmony - a coming together of flower and fruit.</p>
        
                <h3>Notes</h3>
        
                <p>The tangy coolness of a few fresh-picked blackcurrant berries. Lively, flowery rose accents.</p>
                
                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                
                <p>Suitable for small and medium-sized rooms</p>
                <p>Fragrance gradually released and persistent (optimal after around 20 minutes).</p>
                <p>There is no limit on the size of the space as long as you keep an eye on the candle.</p>
                <p>Burning time: around 50 hours</p>

                <h3>Feu De Bois</h3>

                <img src="img/feu-de-bois.jpeg">
                <p>Ode to winter: wax conjuring up an open fire that flames and crackles, here encased in a coloured hand-blown glass vessel.</p>
        
                <h3>Notes</h3>
        
                <p>Warm and familiar, as evocative as Proust's famous madeleine, this large scented candle infuses the air with its dense, woody scent.</p>
                
                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                
                <p>Suitable for small and medium-sized rooms</p>
                <p>Fragrance gradually released and persistent (optimal after around 20 minutes).</p>

                <p>Burning time: around 75 hours</p>

                <h3>Figuier</h3>

                <img src="img/figuier.jpeg">
                <p>Stretching endlessly along the Mediterranean shoreline: fig trees in the hot sun, their perfume borne on the warm wind.</p>
        
                <h3>Notes</h3>
        
                <p>The Figuier (Fig Tree) scented candle portrays the entire tree. The intense fragrance of the wood blends with the green, slightly fruity accents of a handful of figs as they start to ripen. A foretaste of summer.</p>
                
                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                
                <p>Suitable for small and medium-sized rooms</p>
                <p>Fragrance gradually released and persistent (optimal after around 20 minutes).</p>

                <h3>Roses</h3>

                <img src="img/roses.jpeg">
                <p>A bouquet of fresh flowers, blooming in deepest winter. For the first time, the Rose scented candle is available in a large format.</p>
        
                <h3>Notes</h3>
        
                <p>Its porcelain vessel, stamped with the oval of the Maison, is an invitation to make this luminous ritual last. Gradually, the air fills with fresh, flowery notes. A tribute to a timeless emblem.</p>
